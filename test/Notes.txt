Put 384_AGAR_PLATE_WELL immediately next to 384_AGAR_PLATE- Agreed
If I'm interpreting this correctly, can you change header "Sample Name" to 96_GROWTH_PLATE_WELL-Agreed for this particular column, however would also like some unique ID column for each sample since we aren't generating strain IDs in the traditional sense. Suggest a concatenation of the 96_GROWTH_PLATE+96_GROWTH_PLATE_WELL into an additional  "Sample Name/ID" column to make a unique "G0000426B7" for JMP analysis purposes
Remove column echo_well_pick_actionTime since it is already represented by header EchoCherryPick_well_pick_actionTime-These look to be duplicates to me, only need one
Autiomation_SerialNum - change to EchoCherryPick_Biomek_SerialNum if it was pulled from the method file with for the cherrypick from agar plate
For Sol Conc. (ng/ul) and Insol Conc. (ng/ul),  if there is no data, I would return an empty cell so when you move this into JMP, the column will immediately map to a continuous float data type rather than a string- Agreed, for JMP they need to be non values/empty (JMP treats "0" as a value and will graph it)
I am thinking about what to do with the protein information (Size, Sequence). This won't come from any of the Echo/Biomek log files but Analytical will need access to it during CGE analysis. I don't have a good proposal at the moment or even if we need to include that info in this consolidation script
